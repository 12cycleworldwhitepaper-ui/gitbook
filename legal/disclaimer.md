## Important Notice

This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or investment advice. By accessing this information, you acknowledge and agree to the terms below.

## 1. General Disclaimer

* **Nature of Token**: The 12cycle (12C) token is a utility token designed specifically for the 12cycle ecosystem. It is not a security, investment contract, or a financial instrument in any jurisdiction.
* **No Advice**: Nothing in this document should be construed as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy. You should consult with professional legal and financial advisors before participating in the ecosystem.

## 2. No Guarantees & Forward-Looking Statements

* **Future Value**: The 12C team makes no guarantees regarding the future value, liquidity, or price stability of the 12C token.
* **Development Success**: The roadmap represents our current vision, but successful implementation depends on various technical and market factors. Listing on specific exchanges (CEX/DEX) is not guaranteed.

_Note: This disclaimer is a summary. A full legal opinion should be sought independently. Participants should carefully consider the following risks before acquiring 12C tokens._

## Risk Factors

## 1. Market & Liquidity Risk

* **Volatility**: 12C tokens may experience extreme price volatility due to market sentiment and the nature of bonding curve launches via 4Meme.
* **Liquidity**: There is no guarantee of an active secondary market. Liquidity migration to DEXs like PancakeSwap is subject to the completion of the bonding curve.

## 2. Technical & Platform Risk

* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: While 12C strives for security, the underlying smart contracts may be subject to unknown bugs or exploits.
* **Network Dependency**: The ecosystem operates on the BNB Chain. Any network congestion, forks, or failures of the underlying blockchain may affect 12C’s functionality.

## 3. Regulatory & Legal Risk

* **Regulatory Shift**: Changes in global or local regulations regarding Web3, NFTs, and utility tokens may restrict the development or availability of the 12C ecosystem.
