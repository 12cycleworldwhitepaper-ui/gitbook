# Tech Architecture

The tech architecture of 12C is built upon the high-performance infrastructure of the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and the fair token issuance mechanism of the 4Meme launchpad. This framework allows us to implement ancient wisdom onto the blockchain in the most modern and efficient manner possible.

## 1. Multi-Layered Infrastructure

* Layer 1: Identity Layer (BSC-Based SBT)
  * Individual Saju and Astrological data are recorded as Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) on the BNB Smart Chain.
  * Leveraging BSC’s low gas fees, users can record and update their destiny data on-chain without financial burden, ensuring all data is preserved in an immutable and tamper-proof format.
* Layer 2: Launch & Liquidity Layer (Powered by 4Meme)
  * The initial formation of the 12C token ecosystem takes place through the 4Meme platform.
  * By utilizing 4Meme’s Fair Launch mechanism, we minimize dumping risks from pre-sales or team allocations, securing transparent, community-driven liquidity. This serves as the core foundation for the fairness of the PoC reward system.
* Layer 3: Logic Layer (AI Matching Engine)
  * This layer houses the AI engine that processes Eastern and Western metaphysical logic. It utilizes BSC’s rapid block generation speed to calculate real-time "Destiny Resonance" between users and provide immediate on-chain feedback for matching results.

## 2. Core Components

#### 2.1. SBT-12C: Non-Transferable Identity

* BSC Native Standard: Built on BSC’s native protocols, the SBT acts as a "Digital Amulet" and a "Destiny Passport" for the user.
* Immutable Reputation: The activity history of users who prove their early participation through 4Meme is permanently inscribed on their SBT, granting them special "Early Contributor" weights within the ecosystem.

#### 2.2. 4Meme Bonding Curve Sustainability

12C tokens utilize the Bonding Curve model of 4Meme to establish initial value.

* Sustained Growth: Once initial liquidity is secured, the value generated through Proof of Culture (PoC) is linked with the token pricing model, enhancing the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.
* Fair Reward: In accordance with the transparent distribution principles of 4Meme, all rewards are distributed via the PoC engine to users who perform actual content consumption and social activities.

#### 2.3. AI Compatibility Engine (ACE)

* ACE analyzes the "Five Elements" (Saju) and planetary alignments (Astrology). These analytical results are combined with on-chain data via BSC Oracles to provide real-time guidance on which connections will maximize a user's PoC rewards.

## 3. Tech Flow (Data & Value Circulation)

* Fair Launch: 12C tokens are issued fairly through 4Meme, establishing initial liquidity.
* Onboarding: Users input Saju/Astrology data → Analysis is performed → BSC-based SBT is minted.
* Cultural Interaction: Users engage with IP content and matching activities → PoC Oracle verifies the level of contribution.
* Value Distribution: Based on verified contributions, 12C token rewards are immediately distributed through the BSC network.
