# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

12C operates under a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) known as "The Grand Council." Governance in 12C goes beyond simple voting; it is a cultural decision-making process that symbolizes the harmony of East and West.

#### 1. Voting Power & Reputation

We utilize a hybrid voting model to ensure fairness:

* **Token Weight**: Voting rights proportional to 12C token holdings.
* **SBT Reputation Boost**: Multipliers are applied based on a user’s PoC contribution level recorded in their SBT. This prevents "Whale dominance" and empowers dedicated community members.

#### 2. Governance Scope

The Grand Council decides on critical issues such as:

* **PoC Calibration**: Adjusting reward multipliers to manage token inflation.
* **Treasury Allocation**: Deciding how to spend ecosystem reserves (e.g., for new IP acquisition or buy-backs).
* **Protocol Upgrades**: Approving new smart contracts or technical integrations on BSC.

#### 3. The Path to Decentralization

12C aims for progressive decentralization. As the ecosystem matures, an increasing percentage of the Treasury and PoC parameters will be handed over to the Grand Council, ensuring that the project remains a "public good" for the global 12 Zodiac community.
