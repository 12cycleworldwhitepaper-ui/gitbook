# Welcome to 12C (12 Cycle) World

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/12 Cycle.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**12C (12 Cycle)** is a Web3-based cultural project that reinterprets the **Eastern 12 Zodiac Animals (Chinese Zodiac signs)** and the **Western Zodiac (the twelve houses of the Zodiacs)** on-chain to realize&#x20;

**“Connecting Cultures, Cycling Value.”**

Across Web3 universes, we enable people to explore their destined connections through their _**saju**_**&#x20;(Four Pillars) and star signs**, while building a borderless digital culture ecosystem where anyone can participate and prove their cultural contributions.

## Core Concept

12C (12 Cycle) goes beyond a simple “Meeting of East and West.”\
By using AI to analyze **Four Pillars of Destiny (saju)** and **astrology**, it helps you discover people who are truly compatible with you, verify those connections on-chain, and ultimately meet and interact across borders, both online and offline.

In addition, 12C leverages **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** to encode each individual’s saju and astrological information as a non-transferable on-chain identity, and builds a matching system that analyzes and confirms compatibility with others based on these tokens. Once your destiny data is inscribed, it becomes a unique “destiny profile” that cannot be traded or altered, forming the foundation for deeper and more precise connections.

In this way, every encounter, act of creation, and collaboration becomes part of a living, borderless digital cultural ecosystem, where people connect with people and cultures connect with cultures. We extend individual destiny, relationships, and culture into a single **“Proof of Culture (PoC)”** layer that is shared across the entire Web3 universe.
