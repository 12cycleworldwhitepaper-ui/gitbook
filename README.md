# Welcome to 12C (12 Cycle) World

12C (12 Cycle) is a Web3-based cultural project that reinterprets the **Eastern 12 Zodiac Animals (Chinese Zodiac signs)** and the **Western Zodiac (the twelve houses of the Zodiacs)** on-chain to realize&#x20;

**“Connecting Cultures, Cycling Value.”**

Across Web3 universes, we enable people to **explore their destined connections** through their _saju_ (Four Pillars) and star signs, while building a **borderless digital culture ecosystem** where anyone can participate and prove their cultural contributions.

## Core Concept

The **12cycle Coin (12C)** serves as evidence of participation in the cultural ecosystem. We utilize blockchain technology to create a **"Proof of Culture"** protocol, recording cultural contributions transparently.

## Key Features

* **Universal IP:** 12 Zodiac characters designed for global scalability.
* **Proof of Culture:** On-chain verification of cultural activities (Webtoons, Games, etc.).
* **DAO Governance:** Community-driven decision making.
* **Multi-Chain:** Built on Arbitrum One (Layer 2) for efficiency.
