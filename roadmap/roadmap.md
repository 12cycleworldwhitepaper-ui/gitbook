# Development Plan

12C's journey starts by turning ancient wisdom into on-chain data. It continues by allowing global users to turn their destinies into assets, eventually creating a grand cultural ecosystem through human connections and harmony.

## Phase 1: Genesis & Fair Launch (Q4 2025)

**Q4 2025 | Intellectual Property (IP) & Character Branding**

## Phase 2: Ecosystem Expansion & DApp Launch (2026)

**1. Web3 Destiny DApp ‘12C Compass’ Alpha**

**3. Intellectual Property (IP) & Character Branding**

* **12 Zodiac Guardians**: Unveiling the "12 Zodiac Guardians" character IPs designed for a global audience. Each character features a unique lore synchronized with the user’s destiny data.

**4. NFT Marketplace & Creator Economy**

* **Guardian NFTs**: Official minting of the 12 Zodiac Guardian NFTs, offering ecosystem utilities such as staking boosters and governance voting rights.
* **Creator Support Program**: Launch of a platform dedicated to supporting creators in producing secondary content, webtoons, and animations using 12C’s destiny-based IP.

## Phase 3: Meta-Culture & Future Tech Integration (2027)

**1. 12C Meta-Game: "The Destiny Chronicles"**

* **GameFi Launch**: Release of a strategic RPG or simulation game where a user's actual on-chain Saju (destiny) data determines their character's base stats and unique skills.
* **Play-to-Prosper**: Construction of a dynamic gaming economy where reward efficiency and drop rates fluctuate based on the user's destiny flow (Dae-un/Se-un).

**2. Smart Glass AR Integration: "Destiny Vision"**

* **AR Destiny Interface**: Launch of 'Destiny Vision,' an interface compatible with Smart Glasses that allows users to visualize energy flows and compatibility (Gung-hap) data in the real world via Augmented Reality.
* **Real-time Destiny Encounters**: Implementation of a real-time matching system where Smart Glass users can instantly identify and connect with destiny-compatible partners in physical spaces through seamless on-chain interface synchronization.

**3. Global Cultural Ecosystem & AR Gaming**

* **AR Location-Based Gaming (LBS)**: Launch of a location-based AR gaming service using Smart Glasses, allowing users to collect 'Zodiac Guardians' or trigger destiny-related events at specific real-world landmarks.
* **Global Meetup Tours**: Hosting '12C Night,' a series of global networking events that bridge on-chain connections to reality, featuring interactive AR-powered social experiences.

**4. DAO Governance & Universal Oracle API**

* **Full Decentralization**: Transitioning to a complete DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where the community directly governs the project’s strategic direction and cultural funds.
* **The Grand Legacy**: Establishing 12C as a 'Digital Cultural Heritage' by combining sophisticated destiny APIs with AR technology, setting a new standard for daily life beyond the Web3 space.
