# Allocation & Vesting

The 12C project places the highest value on transparency and fairness. By adopting the Bonding Curve model of the 4Meme platform, we realize a Fair Distribution that is truly community-centric.

## Token Overview

* **Token Name:** 12 Cycle (12C)
* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000
* **Network:** Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

## Anti-Dumping & Sustainability

12C utilizes the technical foundation of 4Meme to effectively mitigate early-stage "dumping" risks and ensure long-term ecosystem health.

* Fair Launch Priority: On the 4Meme platform, every participant starts on a level playing field. There are no pre-sales or private allocations for VCs or large-scale investors, ensuring a truly decentralized beginning.
* Bonding Curve Mechanism: Initial pricing is determined by a transparent bonding curve. Tokens are migrated to major DEXs (such as PancakeSwap) only after sufficient liquidity has been established, facilitating stable price discovery.
* PoC Calibration: The PoC engine algorithmically regulates the token emission rate. If the market faces an oversupply of tokens, the system defends against inflation by dynamically adjusting reward multipliers.
